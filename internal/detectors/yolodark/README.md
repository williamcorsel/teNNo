# YOLOv4 on Darknet Object Detection

This YOLOv4 required [darknet](https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet) to run. Build darknet following the steps [here](https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet#how-to-use-yolo-as-dll-and-so-libraries) and place the `libdarknet.so` file in this directory.

NOTE: GPU version of darknet is required for optimal performance.

Download Yolov4 weights from [here](https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/releases/download/darknet_yolo_v3_optimal/yolov4.weights) and place them in the weights folder.
