# Tensorflow Object Detection

This tf module allows the execution of Tensorflow models on the drone. It allows for the detection of a single obstacle and can interact with the avoidance module.

This module requires Tensorflow to run:

```bash
pip install Tensorflow
```

Furthermore, the Tensorflow object detection API is required. Install instructions can be found [here](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/installation.md)
